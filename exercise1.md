A small team of 6 have been assigned a project to build a **blogging web application** coupled with social media functionalities that enable user to create, edit and delete blogs and even interact with blogs written by other individuals.
The teams' language of choice to build the such application was opted to be **C#** to take advantage of MVC architecture offered by the **.NET Core Framework** for fast development process and easy maintenance.

After the code is push to the mainline, the couple of steps involved and its associated tools during continuous integrations are:
- Linting - This can be achieved using **StyleCop**. But for more configurational capabilities, one may even opt for **FXCop** which performs binary analysis unlike **StyleCop** which performs source code analysis. **Resharper** being another option.
- Testing - Done through unit testing suite such as **xUnit** which is also compatible with **Resharper**.
- Build- **C#** being a compiled language, it needs to be compiled into an executable for the application to function. This can be automated in the configuration file such as a **YAML file** in the integration server.

Next step is a requirement of some kind of dedicated continuous integration server. Since, it is unclear as to how much traction this web application would gain in the near future and being a small to medium sized project without any special requirement managed by a team of 6, a typical cloud-based environment such as **GitLab** is sufficient and less complicated to setup. **GitLab** also offers a free version which can be used for developmental, experimentation and testing before rolling out to purchase the premium versions for production-based environment.
